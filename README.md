    - [X] do while
- [ ] Add expression operators:
    - [X] ++,--
    - [X] Add { init_value } to initilize all positions with same value
    - [ ] Add 'in' operator to check if anything is in array/string
    - [ ] immediate if
    - [X] typeof: returns type of object
        - [X] add namespace to type name return
    - [X] typeid: returns hash of typeof
- [X] Add built in funcs:
    - [X] len: returns size of array/string
- [X] Let functions return array
- [X] Add lib scope lib.(method|properties|struct)
- [X] Guanrantee that a lib is loaded once
- [X] Flex function return (currently it's mandatory specificate the return type)
- [X] Remove struct as bool in expression and change this type of verification to void value comparation (eg: var == null)
- [X] Move function body parser to caller node (as interpreter), to check parameters of each caller
- [ ] Console control tools
    - [X] Set caret position
    - [X] Change color
    - [X] Set font
    - [ ] ...
- [ ] Improve error system (based on C++)
- [ ] Improve REPL:
    - [ ] Now expressions can be executed in statements, dont need more to execute expression parser directly
- [X] Add a default interface to implements built in functions
- [X] Add a default interface to implements core libs
- [ ] General otimizations:
    - [ ] Remove duplicate codes
        - [ ] Organize semantic duplicated checks
    - [X] Move some verifications to semantic analisys:
        - [X] Array size check from interpreter

        - [ ] Queue
        - [ ] Stack
        - [ ] Dict
    - [ ] Util?

## Known bugs
- [X] When a struct is passed by parameter, it can't be assigned as null, it occurs because it's passed just the strcut reference and not the variable
- [ ] Can't assing string position
- [X] Parser can't handle unary assign operators when its inside a expression, as declaration expression its work (eg print(i++))
- [X] This does not always return the expected value, eg when its inside a function tha does not has in main file

## Errors
- Errors has CP prefix, eg. CP9999
- Token errors init with 1
- Lexer errors init with 2
- Semantic scope errors init with 3
- Semantic analyser errors init with 4
- Interpreter scope errors init with 5
- Interpreter errors init with 6

## Rules

### Arrays
- If an array has your size defined in declaration, it can just assigned and reassigned with a same size and dimension array expression.

### Types
- If an variable is not defined, it's undef, and it can be initialized with null or a value.
- Variable has a type, if it is defined, it is fixed, else it will be any and the type can change.
- If a variable is not an array, it can not be assined, even if it be any.
