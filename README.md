## Improvements from existent resources
- [X] Automatically find and load included libs without to send by command line arguments

## Known bugs
- [X] Some function definition are not being found:
    - [X] `var arr = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}` X `fun arr_size(arr[])`
    - [X] `var arr = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}` X `fun arr_size(arr[])`
- [X] Undefined variables cant be assigned
- [X] Array items cant verified correctly
- [ ] Check behaviour of rest arrays and why join and print haven't the same signature
- [X] Return is not returning in some cases eg `while(){if(){return;}}`
- [X] This is not working on libs, maybe set lib name in current name
- [X] Fix references
    - [X] Remove reference from variable
    - [X] Function call is not taking account value ref
- [X] Test function as parameter or variable behaviour when already exists a function with its name
    - [X] Fix function assign, i cant declare function in expression evaluation of a declaration node...
    - [X] change consume semicolon to stack
- [X] Interpreter is not checking null struct values correctly
- [X] Throw an error when trying to pass char to string or int to float reference in function parameter
- [X] function shadowing IS GENERATING ERROR
- [X] When a struct is passed by parameter, it can't be assigned as null, it occours because it's passed just the strcut reference and not the variable
- [X] Can't assing string position
- [X] Parser can't handle unary assign operators when its inside a expression, as declaration expression its work (eg print(i++))
- [X] This does not always return the expected value, eg when its inside a function tha does not has in main file
- [X] If file is empty, it throw error
- [X] If an statement is before include, it generate a semantic error
- [X] Assigning struct values on constructors is not checking types correctly
- [X] Function call strcut, string and array acessors is not working
- [X] print({0,2} + {0,2}); is passing semantic analisys
- [X] functions with no block are not checked (should check if is builtin)
- [X] some expression nodes aren't cleaning return type like void funcions
    - [X] add undefined checks after expression semantical analysis
- [X] reference is not working properly
- [X] searching functions in scope, it will not handle struct type
- [X] struct assign seems not working in semantical analisys

## Errors
- Errors has CP prefix, eg. CP9999
- Token errors init with 1
- Lexer errors init with 2
- Semantic scope errors init with 3
- Semantic analyser errors init with 4
- Interpreter scope errors init with 5
- Interpreter errors init with 6

## Rules

### Arrays
- If an array has your size defined in declaration, it can just assigned and reassigned with a same size and dimension array expression.

### Types
- If an variable is not defined, it's undef, and it can be initialized with null or a value.
- Variable has a type, if it is defined, it is fixed, else it will be any and the type can change.
- If a variable is not an array, it can not be assined, even if it be any.
